Why use PDO:-

1) Prevents sql injection. When we use prepare query it precompiles the sql statement and then sends the data to the server for execution. So it stops SQL
injection.

2) PDO is more portable

3) It is better for handling errors. Everything you write in PDO has to be put in a try/catch block.
